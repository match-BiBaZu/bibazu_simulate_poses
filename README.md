# bibazu_simulate_poses
A Blender-based simulation tool designed to model and visualize workpieces being dropped onto flat surfaces from a chute. This repository contains scripts and assets that enable the creation of dynamic simulations for evaluating how various workpieces behave under controlled drops. 

Steps to get it running:

Install:
  -Blender
  -numpy-stl
  -numpy
  -mpl.toolkits.mplot3d.art3d

Unzip (make sure to take them out of their zipped folders):
  -Surfaces
  -Workpieces
  -SimulationData
